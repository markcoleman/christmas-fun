# GitHub Copilot Instructions

This repository contains the "Christmas Fun" project - a festive, software-engineer-themed telling of the night before Christmas, updated for 2025.

## Project Overview

- **Type**: Node.js TypeScript CLI application with GitHub Pages website
- **Theme**: AI-powered holiday coding experience featuring GitHub Copilot agents, MCP (Model Context Protocol), and modern 2025 tech
- **Languages**: TypeScript, JavaScript, HTML, CSS

## Code Style Guidelines

### TypeScript/JavaScript
- Use ES modules (`import`/`export`) syntax
- Prefer `async`/`await` over callbacks and raw promises
- Use TypeScript interfaces for type safety
- Follow existing patterns in the codebase for consistency

### Story Content (JSON files)
- Maintain the festive, tech-themed narrative style
- Include references to modern AI tooling (Copilot, agents, MCP)
- Use appropriate colors from the chalk library palette

### GitHub Pages (docs/)
- Use modern CSS with CSS custom properties (variables)
- Implement glassmorphism design patterns
- Ensure responsive design for mobile devices
- Include accessibility features (ARIA labels, focus states, reduced motion support)

## Testing

- Run tests with `npm test`
- Tests use Vitest with coverage reporting
- Mock console.log and Math.random for predictable tests
- Build with `npm run build`

## Easter Eggs

The project includes environment-based easter eggs:
- `RUN_EASTER_EGG=true` - Special message
- `ONCALL=true` - On-call engineer message
- `CODE_COVERAGE=XX%` - Custom coverage percentage
- Random chance (10%) for debug log easter egg
- Random chance (30%) for Santa ASCII art

## Agent Performance Tips

When working with this codebase:
1. Keep the holiday spirit in all code changes
2. Reference 2025 tech trends appropriately (AI agents, Copilot, MCP)
3. Maintain backwards compatibility with existing tests
4. Use meaningful commit messages with holiday flair
